I have added the scenarios/acceptance criteria in the related pdf folder.
I have created 3 tests with the related names : adapt.spec.js & adapt.spec2.js & adapt.spec3.js
All tests have been build and tested in vs code.
All tests pass
Note** the adapt.spec.js test passes if option show browser is unchecked.
